# Datasets from Brazilian Weather Stations

# DATA SET INFORMATION:

Data comes originally from INMET - Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (inmet.gov.br)

This dataset contains monthly data of air humidity, cloudiness, rainfall, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and mean temperature obtained from four brazilian weather stations: Manaus, Sao Paulo, Natal, and Porto Alegre. Data were collected from Jan./1990 to Dec./2015.

Number of samples in each dataset: 312.
Number of attributes: 6.

The datasets were used in:

Soares, E.; Costa Jr., P.; Costa, B.; Leite, D.
"Ensemble of Evolving Data Clouds and Fuzzy Models for Weather Time Series Prediction."
Applied Soft Computing - Elsevier, xx-x, 2018.

to develop evolving prediction models.

The intention of the datasets is to help others to obtain the same data and replicate our experiments.
