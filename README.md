# Datasets from Brazilian Weather Stations

- DATA SET INFORMATION

Data comes originally from INMET - Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (inmet.gov.br)

These datasets contain monthly data of air humidity, cloudiness, rainfall, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and mean temperature obtained from four brazilian weather stations: Manaus, Sao Paulo, Natal, and Porto Alegre. Data were collected from January of 1990 to December of 2015.

Number of samples in each dataset: 312.
Number of attributes: 6.

The datasets were used in:

Soares, E.; Costa Jr., P.; Costa, B.; Leite, D.
"Ensemble of Evolving Data Clouds and Fuzzy Models for Weather Time Series Prediction."
Applied Soft Computing - Elsevier, xx-x, 2018.

to develop evolving prediction models.

The intention of the datasets is to help others to obtain the same data and replicate our experiments.


- ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION

Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit

  1 - Humidity / continuous / Grams of water vapor per cubic meter of air (g/m3)

  2 - Cloudiness / continuous / Okta (O)

  3 - Rainfall	/ continuous / Millimeters per square meter (mm/m^2)

  4 - Maximum temperature / continuous / Degrees Celsius (C)

  5 - Minimum temperature / continuous / Degrees Celsius (C)

  6 - Mean temperature / continuous	/ Degrees Celsius (C)

The mean temperature is the value to predict.
